Project Title: "My First Microgame" 

Description: My game is a go-karting game with lots of fun obstacles and collectable items that'll sure to make it funner.

Setup Instructions: To play my game, open it and then press play. A menu screen will pop up and from there press play, and follow the objectives.

Reflection: In this project, I learned that prefabs are a great way to duplicate game objects such as obstacles and collectables and such instead of making a new one and coding it, I found out that there are ways to change variables without going into the script by using a private or public float to change it directly from the Unity Editor. And lastly, I found out you can publish a game and turn it into a web one.
